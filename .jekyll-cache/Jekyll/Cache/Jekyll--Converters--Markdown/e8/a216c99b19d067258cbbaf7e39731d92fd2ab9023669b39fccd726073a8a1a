When using Apache Camel with Quarkus as of today, we are limited number of Camel connectors. One important one being
the Apache Kafka connector.
The Kafka connector provided through the Smallrye Kafka Extension is available for Quarkus though. So in this
article, I will show how to
wire Smallrye Kafka connector and Camel together.
We will also be using the camel-servlet component to reuse the undertow http endpoint provided by Quarkus and to
spice things up a little we will use the XML DSL of Camel.
All of this will be natively compiled in the end.</p>
